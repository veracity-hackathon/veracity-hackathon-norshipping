This repository contains code samples and documentation for **Emissions Prediction Calculator API (EPC)**.

The code samples are intended to allow a quick start and show how you can query API in **Python** and **C#**. Additionally sample **Postman** collection file was provided to allow querying the API via GUI.

You can also use `epc.openapi.json` file to get the full API specification. This file follows Open API standard and can be imported to tools such as Postman.

Code samples summary:
1.	Sample project in C#: TODO
2.	Sample project in Python: TODO
3.	Sample collection file in Postman:  
You can import the collection file into Postman `(File -> Import)`. Once imported a new collection **EPC API Hackaton** is created and can be used to query the API. You need to replace header parameter `{{subscribtion-key}}` with a subscription key you have received.  You can get Postman form here https://www.postman.com/
